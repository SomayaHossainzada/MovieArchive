            <h2>Final Fantasy</h2>
            <p>
                Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a 2001 adult animated science fiction film directed by Hironobu
                Sakaguchi, creator of the Final Fantasy franchise. It was the first photorealistic computer-animated
                feature film and the most expensive video game-inspired film until the release of Prince of Persia: The
                Sands of Time in 2010. The film stars the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, James
                Woods, Ving Rhames, Peri Gilpin, and Steve Buscemi, and follows scientists Aki Ross and Doctor Sid in
                their efforts to free a post-apocalyptic Earth from the Phantoms, a mysterious, deadly alien race who
                has driven the remnants of humanity into "barrier cities". Aki and Sid must fight against General Hein,
                who wants to use more violent means to end the conflict.
                Square Pictures rendered the film using some of the most advanced processing capabilities available at
                the time. A render farm of 960 workstations was tasked with rendering each of the film's 141,964 frames.
                It took a staff of 200 about four years to complete The Spirits Within. Square intended to make the
                character of Aki Ross into the world's first photorealistic computer-animated actress, with plans for
                appearances in multiple films in different roles.
