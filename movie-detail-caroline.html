                Coraline is a 2009 American stop-motion animated dark fantasy horror film written and directed by Henry
                Selick, based on Neil Gaiman's novella of the same name. Produced by LAIKA, as the studio's first
                feature film, it features the voice talents of Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn
                French, Keith David, John Hodgman, Robert Bailey Jr., and Ian McShane. The musical score is by Bruno
                Coulais. The film tells the story of its eponymous character discovering an idealized alternate universe
                behind a secret door in her new home, unaware that it contains something dark and sinister.
                Just as Gaiman was finishing his novella in 2002, he met Selick and invited him to make a film
                adaptation, as Gaiman was a fan of Selick's other stop-motion projects, The Nightmare Before Christmas
                (1993) and James and the Giant Peach (1996). When Selick thought that a direct adaptation would lead to
                "maybe a 47-minute movie", the screenplay was expanded. Looking for a design different from that of most
                animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become
                the concept artist. His biggest influences were on the color palette, which was muted in the real world
                and more colorful in the Other World, as in The Wizard of Oz. To capture stereoscopy for the 3D release,
                the animators shot each frame from two slightly apart camera positions. Production of the stop-motion
                animation feature took place at a warehouse in Hillsboro, Oregon.
