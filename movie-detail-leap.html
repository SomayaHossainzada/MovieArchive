                Ballerina (titled Leap! in the United States) is a 2016 3D animated musical adventure comedy film
                co-directed by √âric Summer and √âric Warin and written by Summer, Carol Noble and Laurent Zeitoun. A
                co-production between Canadian and French companies, the film takes place in 1880s France and follows an
                orphan girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina and gets a chance to audition for the celebrated school
                of the Paris Opera Ballet.
                Ballerina stars the voices of Elle Fanning, Dane DeHaan, Maddie Ziegler and Carly Rae Jepsen. The film
                was released in cinemas in France and the United Kingdom on 12 December 2016, followed by releases in
                various countries over the following several months, including Canada on 24 February 2017. The film was
                released in the United States on 25 August 2017, with the voices of Nat Wolff (who replaced DeHaan),
                Kate McKinnon and Mel Brooks added. Ballerina received generally mixed reviews from critics, but was a
                box office success, grossing $106.1 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.
