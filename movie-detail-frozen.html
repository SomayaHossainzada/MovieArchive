            <h2>Frozen</h2>
            <p>
                Frozen is a 2013 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and
                released by Walt Disney Pictures. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's 1844 fairy tale, "The Snow
                Queen", it was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee (in her feature directorial debut) and produced
                by Peter Del Vecho, from a screenplay by Lee, who also conceived the film's story with Buck and Shane
                Morris.
                The film stars the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad and Santino Fontana,
                with Alan Tudyk, Ciar√°n Hinds, Maia Wilson, Chris Williams, Stephen J. Anderson, Paul Briggs, Livvy
                Stubenrauch, Eva Bella, Maurice LaMarche, and Lee in supporting roles. The film follows Anna, the
                princess of Arendelle, who sets off on a journey with the iceman Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and the
                snowman Olaf to find her estranged sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped their kingdom in eternal
                winter.
